# Advent of Code 2020 solutions
Here are my solutions of the 2020 AoC, written in Clojure.
I added comments to make it understandable even for Clojure newbies. If you have questions about the code, don't hesitate to ask me.
I heavily use the REPL to solve the puzzles, so it might be that I leave out details needed for the calculation.
For example, just copy the puzzle input into the REPL and apply a (string/split-lines input) to it, 
to the input as a list.

I did some makeup for the most solutions afterwards, but I always leave the key solution to the puzzles as they were in my first run.
